# WUPInstaller-AnyTitle
This version of WupInstaller has the Black/White list removed, so any title may be installed.
It can also install titles to a WiiU USB formatted device!

NOTE: Only install Retail/Dev Titles or any other titles that require a Signed Ticket, Onto a Signature patched Emunand or REDNand, Failure to do so will result faulty data and/or "???" titles that will not launch!

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE install "System" Titles on your Sysnand as that writes to the SLC partition of NAND... and if something goes wrong your shit is fucked.

Works with HBL only.
Set up in SD:/WiiU/apps/WUPInstaller/

Put Nand Image in SD:/Install
